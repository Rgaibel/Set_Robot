# Set_Robot
using Machine Learning and Dynamic Programming, a board will light the colors around the cards that create a set in the game Set

Initial Design
    Hardware:
        Board
        Cut 3x3 matrix for cards
        Build stand to hold camera that can see the whole matrix
        Wiring or bluetooth
    Software:
        Stage 1: Machine learning algorithm (tensor flow) that recognizes the cards
        Recognizes shape, color, and filling
        Stage 2: Algorithm that wins set with given input
        Stage 3: output lights on locations of cards in set

Tasks until 17/10
    Open github
    Gather material: camera, wooden board, raspberry pi, lights
    Look into tensor flow with object recognition camera Machine Learning

Tasks until 24/10
    Have algorithm options for set
